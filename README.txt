1. Overview

onego.com is a loyalty system, which allows merchants to create, manage, publish and analyze loyalty campaigns.
This extension integrates e-shop as a point-of-sale for the merchant, by allowing buyers to participate in merchant's
loyalty campaigns by tracking active offers, using them, collecting and spending their personal benefits.
This extension provides seamless and unintrusive buying experience for the buyer while encouraging them to become loyal
and returning customers.

2. Installation

2.1. Prerequisites

This extension is tested and compatible with these Opencart versions: 1.5.0, 1.5.0.1, 1.5.0.2, 1.5.0.3, 1.5.0.4,
1.5.0.5, 1.5.1, 1.5.1.1, 1.5.1.2, 1.5.1.3, 1.5.2, 1.5.2.1
VQMOD is required for easier installation, but extension can also be used without it - you will need to modify Opencart
files manually, though.
PHP CURL extension must be installed on the server.

2.2. Installation

- Simply copy files from src/ directory to root directory of your Opencart installation;
- Open admin interface, go to Extensions > Order Totals, click "Install" for this extension;
- Open extension configuration page to configure it for your OneGo merchant account;
- That's it.

We highly recommend to test the extension with your Opencart installation before making it public, especially if you
have a highly customized e-shop - this extension may be incompatible with other extensions. If this is the case, you
will need a qualified developer to take a look and diagnose the problems.

To install extension without VQMOD, you will have to open vqmod/xml/onego_benefits.xml file and apply changes to
Opencart code defined there manually.
