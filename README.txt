1. Overview

Onego.com allows merchants to create, manage, publish and analyze offers, rewards and
reloadable gift cards. This extension integrates your eShop with OneGo, allowing
customers to use offers, accrue rewards, use gift card balances and allows you to track use.

2. Installation

2.1. Requirements

This extension is tested and compatible with Opencart versions 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3 and 1.5.4.
VQMOD extension is required for easier installation, but extension can also be used without it -
you will need to modify Opencart files manually, though.
PHP CURL extension must be installed on the server.

2.2. Installation

- Simply copy files from src/ directory to root directory of your Opencart installation;
- Open admin interface, go to Extensions > Order Totals, click "Install" for this extension;
- Open extension configuration page to configure it for your OneGo business account;
- Copy template files to your theme directory and modify them if needed.

We highly recommend to test the extension with your Opencart installation before making it public,
especially if you have a highly customized e-shop - this extension may be incompatible with other
extensions.

To install extension without VQMOD, you will have to open vqmod/xml/onego_benefits.xml file and apply
changes configured there to your code manually.
